NO Debugger

Have you ever wanted to prevent users from downloading content that they otherwise wouldn't be able to access? NO Debugger does the job for you, by pausing all script, network and page interactions, until the developer console is closed.

Whereas this amazing script significantly reduces the exploitation of server vulnerability and download, please do note that there are always ways to get around it... even if these skills are only known by a very few. NEVER leave your servers prone to code injections via the console.

### How it works:

Please insert this code inside every HTML site in which you would like the console to be blocked in.

```markdown
<script src="https://no-debugger.github.io/app.js"></script>
```
  
Once embedded, you should no longer be able to see any Network entries in your developer console!

### I hope this program helps people
